## The Arena

------

The Arena is a first person shooter battle royale type videogame that has 100 players fighting each other for victory. This website is meant to be a support for the game, with information and features that aim to convince both casual and hardcore gamers to try it out. It displays the game's main features and instructions on how to play, as well as a sign up page.

## Features

------

-Logo
  
The top of the page includes the logo for The Arena that is present in all of the pages. This is meant to work as a constant reminder of the name of the game for those who are yet unfamiliar with it.

-Navigation Menu 

The navigation menu consists of links to all of the website's pages (home, how to play and sign up). It is a feature in every single one of them, to make navigation easy and intuitive, thus promoting a good user experience.

-Page Image

This image takes center stage in all the pages to entice potential players, while making the website maintain a clean look. It speaks of the type of game The Arena is, and contains the motto for the game, "100 players walk in. Only one walks out." There's also a call to action in the form of a pre-order message that links to the sign up page.

-Statement Section

This section is a short one. It contains text that supports the image above, briefly explaining what the genre of the game is. It also immediately states that the gameplay in The Arena differs form other battle royale games, as a way to grab the attention of potential players.

-Selling Points Section

The selling points section contains more detailed information about the main features of The Arena. It is comprised of short blocks of text spread out across the page. The main objective is to give potential players a better picture of what the game is. 

The section contains four blocks of text, two of which float left, with the remaining two floating right. This styling option makes for a cleaner section, in which there is never too much information clustered in one place.

-Footer

This is where users can find all the social media links, as well as The Arena's official Twitch channel and email. The six icons appear in one row in white to a chocolate colour background, and become opaque when the user hovers over them. Finally, there are aria labels in all of the links for screen readers. 

All the icons were taken from "Font Awesome".

-How to Play page

For players who are not very familiar with the Battle Royale genre, the how to play page provides a list of five steps to make sense of how the game works. Stylewise, it retains the colour scheme and some of the styling of the home page.

-Sign Up Page

For potential players who want to play the game, or just receive updates about it via email. Apart from all the usual fields such as username and password, there is also a dropdown list that gives users three options to sign up.

The colors and fonts are very easy to read all across the website.

**Validator Testing**

HTML- No errors were shown when put through the [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Ffranciscobarreira.github.io%2FHTML-CSS-Project%2Findex.html)

CSS- No errors were shown when put through the [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffranciscobarreira.github.io%2FHTML-CSS-Project%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

**Responsiveness Testing**

The website responsiveness was tested using Chrome Dev Tools and was physically tested on a Samsung S20. It generally responded well to the different devices, however, there was a need to implement some changes, such as:

-Reducing the Logo font size to keep it from overflowing into the navigation bar

-Increasing the Statement Height to keep text from spilling over

-Decreasing the width of the form to fot smaller devices

-In the selling points section of the website, there are four blocks of text, with two of them floating left and the other two floating right. In smaller screens, they form a column instead, with the four of them appearing below one another.
