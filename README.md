## The Arena

------

The Arena is a first person shooter battle royale type videogame that has 100 players fighting each other for victory. This website is meant to be a support for the game, with information and features that aim to convince both casual and hardcore gamers to try it out. It displays the game's main features and instructions on how to play, as well as a sign up page.


## Features

------

-Logo
  
The top of the page includes the logo for The Arena that is present in all of the pages. This is meant to work as a constant reminder of the name of the game for those who are yet unfamiliar with it.

-Navigation Menu 

The navigation menu consists of links to all of the website's pages. It is a feature in every single one of them, to make navigation easy and intuitive, thus promoting a good user experience.

-Page Image

This image takes center stage in all the pages to entice potential players, while making the website maintain a clean look. It speaks of the type of game The Arena is, and contains the motto for the game, "100 players walk in. Only one walks out." There's also a call to action in the form of a pre-order message that links to the sign up page.

-Statement Section

This section is a short one. It contains text that supports the image above, briefly explaining what the genre of the game is. It also immediately states that the gameplay in The Arena differs form other battle royale games, as a way to grab the attention of potential players.

-Selling Points Section

The selling points section contains more detailed information about the main features of The Arena. It is comprised of short blocks of text spread out across the page. The main objective is to give potential players a better picture of what the game is. 

-Footer

This is where users can find all the social media links, as well as The Arena's official Twitch channel and email, which will be the primary form of customer support. 

-How to Play page

For players who are not very familiar with the Battle Royale genre, the how to play page provides a list of steps to make sense of how the game works. Stylewise, It is very identical to the home page to keep the branding consistant. The only differences are in the short message in the statement section and the main text. 

-Sign Up Page

For potential players who want to play the game, or just receive updates about it via email. Apart from all the usual fields such as username and password, there is also a dropdown list that gives users three options to sign up. 

## Testing

**Validator Testing**

HTML-No errors were shown when put through the validator.w3.org/ test.

CSS- No errors were shown when put through the jigsaw.w3.org validator test.






We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
